# Car Parts Segmentation using Python

This project demonstrates how to perform image segmentation to identify and segment car parts using Python. Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to identify different objects or parts. In this project, we specifically focus on car parts, using custom-trained models to detect and segment them from images.

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented image segmentation to detect and segment different parts of cars, such as wheels, headlights, doors, and more. Segmentation is performed using a model that processes the input image and outputs a mask that highlights the segmented car parts. This mask is then applied to the original image to clearly visualize the detected parts.

## Features

- **Car Parts Segmentation**: Automatically detects and segments key car parts from input images.
- **Mask Overlay**: The segmented parts are visualized by overlaying masks on the original image, highlighting each part.
- **Python Integration**: The project is implemented entirely in Python, using popular libraries like OpenCV and segmentation models.

## How It Works

1. **Model Loading**:
   - A pre-trained model is loaded to perform segmentation on the input images. The model identifies car parts based on the trained data.

2. **Image Input**:
   - The input image containing a car is provided to the segmentation model.

3. **Segmentation**:
   - The model processes the image and outputs a mask where the car parts are segmented and classified.
   
4. **Mask Visualization**:
   - The segmented mask is applied to the original image to visualize the detected car parts. Each part is highlighted with a different color for better clarity.

## How to Run

### Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- Any deep learning framework you used for training (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow)
